# InstaDapp

[InstaDapp](https://instadapp.io) smart wallets **do not** have an admin key. There is no single key or multisig that can be used to modify InstaDapp's users' smart wallets. Please note that this only applies to InstaDapp's smart wallets - there is still inherited admin key risk from Compound and any other protocols that InstaDapp supports.
