# Compound

[Compound](https://compound.finance)'s protocol is upgradeable via a single admin key with a 2-day timelock. Compound claims to use an "offline multi-party process" for key security.

**Update: Feb 26, 2020**  
Compound has announced the [development of a token-based governance system](https://medium.com/compound-finance/compound-governance-5531f524cf68) which would aim to eliminate the need for the admin key described here. Transition date is still TBD.
