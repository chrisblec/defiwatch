# MakerDAO

[MakerDAO](https://makerdao.com) smart contracts **do not** have an admin key. There is no single key or multisig that can be used to modify MakerDAO's smart contracts. Any changes must be approved by a governance vote. _Please note that this only relates to admin key risk and MakerDAO is still subject to smart contract risk._
