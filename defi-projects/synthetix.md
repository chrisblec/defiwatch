# Synthetix

### Summary

✅ All code is open source

✅ Never critically hacked or exploited

❌ Voting occurs off-chain

❌ Critical logic can _only_ be modified by a multisig

***

### Who do you need to trust?

Synthetix's protocolDAO is extremely powerful and has the ability to modify core logic or attack user funds. Any such action would be held by a 48-hour timelock, giving the community that time to take action. Whether or not the community would be able to form a reasonable response in that amount of time is unknown. Only the protocolDAO members can begin an Emergency Shutdown, so that would not be an option for tokenholders.

### **Governance Details**

The Synthetix community recently switched its voting system from a simple vote in the chat app Discord over to the off-chain signalling mechanism, [Snapshot](https://snapshot.page/). Another change is planned shortly to move to a proxy voting system labeled [“Spartan Council”](https://sips.synthetix.io/sips/sip-93) which will require users to vote for 7 representatives who will have sole voting power. The most important takeaway here is that **Synthetix voting does** _**not**_ **happen on-chain.**

Once a proposal is approved through voting, **users must trust Synthetix’s protocolDAO to make the modification to the protocol**. protocolDAO is a fancy way of describing a 4-of-8 multisig admin key \(48 hour timelock\). However, action by the protocolDAO is in no way technically connected to the off-chain voting that occurs. Therefore, users _must_ trust the protocolDAO to act responsibly and skillfully.

In addition, **any one member of the protocolDAO has the ability to pause the entire Synthetix system** in the case of an emergency. No vote is required, and no other members of the DAO have to be involved for one member to do this.

As stated in [this Synthetix blog post](https://blog.synthetix.io/synthetix-foundation-decommissioned/), the protocolDAO members _could_ indefinitely stop Synthetix from operating by continually shutting it down over and over. Users must trust the 8 DAO members to act with integrity.

While Synthetix does have a powerful admin key and significant trust requirements, its voting mechanism and strong community place it above other admin key protocols.
